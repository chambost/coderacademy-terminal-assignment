## R5. Scope 

The terminal application **Improv Cloze Drama** aims to recreate the experience of a social game involving word substitutions. It is specifically inspired by the *Mad Lib Theatre* segment of *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*, which in turn is derived from the *Mad Libs* word gamebooks by *Leonard Stern* and *Roger Price*.

The application is an entertainment product that aims to amuse and engage. The author chose to develop it as an homage to the source material.

The target audience is anyone with an affinity for word and social games in general and for this style of entertainment in particular.

In the sections that follow the game of substituting words to comopose a story will be referred to as a *cloze*.

The application can be used in two to three ways: 
1. to write a cloze for others to experience;
2. to experience a cloze already written;
3. (assumming scope and time allows) to spectate the cloze experience of another player

An author can enter free-form text and indicates sections for substitution and type of substitutions permissable.
